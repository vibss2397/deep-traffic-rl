Howdy, partner! ðŸ¤  I love this Doodle Dash concept - it's got a unique creative twist with that drawing-in-progress mechanic. Let me break this down into progressive phases that build on each other, with each phase giving you a complete working state you can test and enjoy.

# Doodle Dash: Development Phases

## Phase 1: Three.js Foundation & Basic Road
- Set up Three.js environment with responsive canvas
- Implement basic camera and scene setup
- Create a simple two-lane road with notebook paper texture
- Add basic lighting
- Implement a simple keyboard input system

At the end of Phase 1, you'll have a static road viewable in 3D space that you can navigate with camera controls.

## Phase 2: Player Car & Movement
- Create a simple doodle car model
- Implement lane-changing mechanics (A/D keys)
- Add speed control (W/S keys)
- Implement car physics (momentum, tilting on turns)
- Add camera follow behavior
- Create basic collision boundary for the car

After Phase 2, you'll have a playable car that moves on a static road section with proper physics.

## Phase 3: Scrolling World & Road Generation
- Implement road segment generation system
- Create scrolling mechanism to move the world past the player
- Develop segment types (straight, left turn, right turn)
- Implement basic road segment recycling for performance
- Add distance tracking for scoring

Phase 3 gives you an endless runner with a continuous road and basic scoring.

## Phase 4: Drawing-in-Progress Core Effect
- Implement "sketch to solid" line rendering system
- Create shader for pencil line effect
- Add pencil cursor at the leading edge of drawing
- Implement opacity/solidity gradient based on distance
- Add subtle sketch jitter to distant elements

This phase brings the core unique mechanic to life - you'll see the road being "drawn" ahead as you drive.

## Phase 5: Basic Obstacles & Collision
- Create simple doodle obstacle models (other cars, pencils, erasers)
- Implement obstacle placement system
- Add basic collision detection
- Implement health bar system instead of lives:
  - Add a notebook paper-style health bar (perhaps looking like a hand-drawn progress bar)
  - Health decreases on collisions (different amounts based on obstacle type)
  - Visual feedback when health changes (paper crumple effect, pencil marks)
- Add simple collision response (car slows or swerves slightly)

## Phase 6: Drawing Effects for Obstacles
- Extend drawing-in-progress effect to obstacles
- Implement erasing/redrawing mechanics
- Add "artist mistakes" with partial draws and corrections
- Implement speed variations in the drawing effect
- Create visual feedback for near-misses
- Add health interactions:
  - Health bar being "erased" when taking damage
  - Potential for health recovery items (fresh pencil marks adding to the bar)
  - Visual cues when health is critically low (paper starting to tear/crumple)

This phase enhances the core mechanic by applying it to all game elements.

## Phase 7: Game States & UI
- Create start screen with instructions
- Implement game over condition and screen
- Add pause functionality
- Create score display and lives indicator
- Implement restart mechanism

Phase 7 gives you a complete game loop with proper UI and state management.

## Phase 8: Audio Integration
- Add pencil scratching sounds for drawing
- Implement eraser sound effects
- Add paper crumpling for collisions
- Create or integrate background music
- Add audio controls (volume, mute)

This phase brings the auditory dimension to enhance immersion.

## Phase 9: Advanced Drawing Effects
- Implement coffee stain obstacles with slippery physics
- Add ink blots that temporarily obscure view
- Create more complex erasing/redrawing animations
- Implement varying artist behavior (hesitant, frantic, confident)
- Add subtle paper texture interactions (crumpling, folding)
- Create power-ups that can repair health (drawn as correction tape or fresh pencil marks)
- Add temporary shield effects (drawn as protective circles around the car)
- Implement varying damage types (heavy smudges for major damage, light marks for minor)
- Add health regeneration over time (slow redrawing of the health bar)
- Create visual effects that tie health to the game world (screen getting more crumpled/smudged as health decreases)



Phase 9 enhances the core mechanic with more variety and sophistication.

## Phase 10: Polish & Optimization
- Performance optimization for 60fps
- Add particle effects (pencil dust, eraser bits)
- Implement difficulty progression
- Add visual polish (shadows, subtle animations)
- Create advanced scoring with combos for near-misses

The final phase refines the experience and ensures smooth performance.

Each phase builds naturally on the previous one, and you'll have something functional and testable at each step. How does this roadmap sound, my fellow techno cowboy? Want me to elaborate on any particular phase?
